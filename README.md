# Portfolio

## Overview

This monorepo contains the portfolio of Jack Siman, hosted [here](https://www.jacksiman.com).

In it you will find my main personal website as well as some other coding examples. All code was written by myself with aid of standard CLI schematics.

## Background 

In my current position as a web developer, I manage and develop SPAs written in Angular and data visualization libraries like d3.js and Leaflet with the purpose of communicating complex information accurately and effectively. Some applications feature state management using NGRX and NGXS. Since these projects are property of my clients, the goal of this repo is to demonstrate my coding ability in lieu of publically accessible projects.
